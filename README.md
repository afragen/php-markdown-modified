Modified version of original PHP Markdown plugin to work along side Markdown on Save variants.

All Markdown markup will be rendered in all posts regardless of setting in Markdown on Save variant.

Better solution for those who have always used Markdown markup would be some method of modifying the setting to **not use** Markdown on posts to **use** Markdown.
